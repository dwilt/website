2. Run `yarn global add webpack && git clone git@github.com:dwilt/website.git && cd website && yarn && webpack` in your terminal.    
3. Open `index.html` in a browser
  
## To start working

1. Inside of the root directory, run `webpack -w`. As you save files, the JS bundle will be recreated. Just hit refresh. No hot loading yet. Don't be so impatient.
2. Get the fuck to work
